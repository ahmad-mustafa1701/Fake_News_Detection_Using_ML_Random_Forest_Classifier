Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is aimed at detecting fake news articles using Machine Learning with a Random Forest Classifier. It uses spaCy for text preprocessing, TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction, and 5-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation. The goal is to create a reliable tool for identifying misinformation in news content.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The original dataset contains 44,921 news articles:

True News â€“ 21,418 entries

Fake News â€“ 23,503 entries

Original Columns:

title â€“ headline of the news

text â€“ body content of the article

subject â€“ category or topic of the news

date â€“ date of publication

label/index â€“ classification (1 = Fake, 0 = Real)

Note: For demonstration and faster training, only 250 fake news and 250 true news records were used, resulting in a dataset of 500 articles.

ðŸ›  Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is done using the spaCy library:

Lowercasing text

Tokenization â€“ breaking text into words

Stopword Removal â€“ removing common but uninformative words

Punctuation Removal

Lemmatization â€“ converting words to their base form

ðŸ“Š Feature Extraction

We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the processed text into numerical feature vectors.

Maximum features: 5000

Removes common and rarely used words to improve model performance

ðŸ¤– Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation: k=5 Fold Cross-Validation

Reason: Random Forest handles high-dimensional data well and reduces overfitting through ensemble learning.

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Model performance is evaluated using metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Average accuracy achieved during 5-fold cross-validation is around 99.80%.
